# Image Resizer

This Python script resizes an image to specified dimensions. It uses the OpenCV library to read, resize, and display the original and resized images.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have OpenCV installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python image_resizer.py
```

3. Follow the prompts:

   - Enter the name of the `.jpg` file (without the extension).
   - Provide the new width and height for the image.

The script will display both the original and resized images and save the resized image with the specified name.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter the name of the .jpg file: example
Enter the new width: 800
Enter the new height: 600
Enter the name for the resized image: example_resized

Resized image saved successfully!
```

## Note

- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- The input image file should be in the same directory as the script, or you should provide the correct file path.
